# EC Mobile App

Expo + React Native + TypeScript template with Tailwind (NativeWind-style utilities), Expo Router, and a small set of UI utilities. Generated by `create-ec-app` for rapid mobile development.

## Features

- Expo Router with typed layouts
- Tailwind utilities for React Native
- Theming helpers for React Navigation (`lib/theme.ts`)
- Utility helpers (`lib/utils.ts` with `cn`)
- Portal support via `@rn-primitives/portal` (included in root layout)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Xcode (macOS) and/or Android Studio SDKs for local simulators
- Expo CLI (installed automatically via `npx`)

## Getting Started

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start development: `npx expo start`
  - Press `i` for iOS simulator, `a` for Android, or scan the QR code with Expo Go

## Key Files

- `app/_layout.tsx`: Root layout with theme provider, Expo Router stack, and `PortalHost`.
- `lib/theme.ts`: Light/dark palettes mapped to React Navigation theme.
- `lib/utils.ts`: `cn` helper for conditional class names.
- `global.css`: Tailwind directives and custom styles (imported by the root layout).

## Styling

- The template uses Tailwind utilities for React Native components. Adjust Tailwind config as needed for your design system.

## Building

- Use the Expo tooling for builds and previews:
  - `npx expo prebuild` to generate native projects (if needed)
  - `npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android` to build and run
  - See the Expo docs for EAS Build for cloud builds
